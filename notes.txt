sudoku data is inside data/sudoku
-sudoku.bin consists of 100 sudoku game examples


overview of steps:
-use Sudoku-RWKV repo to generate sudoku data in the form of jsonl
-use json2binidx_tool to convert that jsonl file to .bin and .idx files (make sure to use the correct sudoku_vocab.txt in the command)
-copy the .bin file over and put it in data/sudoku (.bin files already contain tokenized data)
-train it here
-will now get a .pt file, where we can inspect the model weights and also run inference on it
-for running inference, we need to make sure to use the sudoku_vocab.txt for decoding it properly

train like this:
python train.py config/train_sudoku.py

run inference like this:
python sample_wip.py --out_dir=out-sudoku-char
